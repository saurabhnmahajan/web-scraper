# Web Scraper

A simple program to collect all the links and images on a webpage. I had recently the need to collect 500 images for 3 animals for my Computer Vision project. A lack of a good tool led me to create my own web scraper.

# Dependencies
The application requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Lxml](http://lxml.de/3.0/installation.html) and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/download/) installed on the machine.

# Quick Run
To use the application, run the following command in the terminal: 

`python scraper.py URL [OPTIONS]`

# Options
```
-u    get all links on the URL
-i    save all images in a folder
```
